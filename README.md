# UWFlow-RateMyProf-Integration

Simply, a google chrome extension for uwflow.com where one can click on a professor name and get their RateMyProfessor profile.
Another feature includes pulling up an indoor map when clicking on classroom location. Will add to feature list if I find more inconveniences in the website.
